        <h1>Cryptid Watch: The Mysterious Figures Watching Gina Through the Sliding Glass Door</h1>
        <p><strong>By: A. Shadowseeker</strong></p>
        <p>Gina had always believed in ghosts. She grew up hearing stories about spirits, restless souls, and the strange things that happened when no one was looking. But whatever watched her at night through the sliding glass door—it wasn’t a ghost.</p>
        <p>Most nights, she slept on the couch, wrapped in blankets with her two small dogs, Lalo, a stubborn chiweenie, and Tosi, a sleepy shih tzu. Some nights, they barked at shadows. Other nights, they barely lifted their heads when something rustled outside. Gina told herself that was a good sign. Dogs could sense spirits, right? If they weren’t reacting, then it must be nothing.</p>
        <p>But deep down, she wasn’t so sure.</p>
        <p>Then came the noises...</p>
        <p>Soft, deliberate tapping against the glass. Not the wind, not tree branches—this was different. It had rhythm, intent. Gina would glance toward the sliding door, heart pounding, but by the time she mustered the courage to sit up and really <strong>look</strong>, there was nothing there. Just darkness and the vague reflection of her own wide-eyed face.</p>
        <p>She blamed Jaime and Jared, of course. If her kids had just closed the curtains like she told them, maybe she wouldn’t have the unshakable sense that something—<strong>some things</strong>—were watching.</p>
        <p>One night, she saw them.</p>
        <p>Through the sliver of uncovered glass, just beyond the backyard fence, stood shadowy figures. Tall, thin, hunched in unnatural ways. Their eyes—if they even had eyes—seemed to glint in the moonlight, shifting and darting as if whispering silent words to one another. One of them lifted a long, clawed hand and pressed it gently against the glass.</p>
        <p>Lalo and Tosi didn’t bark. They didn’t growl. They simply lifted their heads, ears twitching, before curling back up beside her as if they knew—<strong>as if they had seen these things before.</strong></p>
        <p>Gina didn’t scream. She couldn’t.</p>
        <p>She simply pulled the blanket over her head and prayed that morning would come quickly.</p>
        <p>Jaime and Jared laughed at her the next morning when she demanded they close the curtains. “It’s just the neighbor’s dog,” Jaime said. “Or the reflection of a tree,” Jared added.</p>
        <p>Gina almost wanted to believe them. <strong>Almost.</strong></p>
        <p>But ghosts didn’t leave claw marks on the glass.</p>
        <p>And that night, when the curtains were once again left open, she lay frozen on the couch as something long and thin pressed its face against the glass… watching.</p>
        <p><strong>Always watching.</strong></p>
        <p>So if you ever find yourself feeling observed late at night, and your curtains are left ajar—ask yourself: Are you alone?</p>
        <p>Or are <strong>they</strong> just waiting for you to notice?</p>
